# Demos

These are the class challenges and walkthroughs.

## To run them
```
cd challenges
ng serve
```
Then browse to http://localhost:4200

## How to do a challenge

Read the challenge on the welcome page, examine the starters (for those that have starters), create any files needed through ng serve, and write the code to solve the challenge.

Solutions can't be surfed to but you can look at them in the solutions-to-challenges folder.

You probably don't want to git commit anything unless you've improved on a solution or starter. The work in progress should be deleted after each class. To do that, go git checkout -- filename(s) or if they're all to be ignored, go git reset --hard.
